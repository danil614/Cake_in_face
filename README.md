## The scenario of the game

The user clicks the "Start the game" button. After that, he abstracts from the stressful reality and embodies cake throwing in virtual reality thanks to our relaxation game. 
The player chooses the scenery and the character to be hit by the cake. Then there is a place on the device screen where this action will take place. The user must tap the screen with his finger in front of the character, depending on the distance of the finger to the cannon, the cake will either fly to the character's face or fly to the floor.
All these actions are accompanied by rather relaxing sounds of purring cats. With each subsequent throwing, the user will feel better
